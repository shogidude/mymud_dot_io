# sandy-admin-template
Admin template using react-router-bootstrap, and React contexts instead of Redux. Created using create-react-app. Uses React contexts, free Font Awesome fonts, and Bootstrap 4.

## Purpose
I spent days looking for a free, opensource, SPA, admin template for a couple of projects that I needed one for. I couldn't find one that used the ReactJS technology stack that I needed, so I made my own. Feel free to use this to bootstart your own projects. If you have code improvements or updates that you want to add, fork this and create a pull request back into this project.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
